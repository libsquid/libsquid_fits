This utility depends on having the base libsquid library and
libsquid_wcs library installed as well as cfitsio (>3.27) and
wcslib (>4.19).

Currently the build system in use is cmake.  The best way to
build the system is to make a build directory in the location
of your choice, cd to it, and then run:
> cmake [OPTIONS] /path/to/libsquid_fits
#Options:
#  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path
#  -DLIBSQUID_INCLUDEDIR=/path/to/libsquid/include
#  -DLIBSQUID_LIBDIR=/path/to/libsquid/lib
#  -DLIBSQUIDWCS_INCLUDEDIR=/path/to/libsquid_wcs/include
#  -DLIBSQUIDWCS_LIBDIR=/path/to/libsquid_wcs/lib
> make
At this point the utility is compiled locally to your build directory.
These programs will give a short usage message if run without arguments.
See the documentation for more details.

To perform a system installation at this point, simply do the following.
> sudo make install
The default install path is to /usr/local.

To build rpms, debs, and tgz files, simply do the following in your
build directory:
> make package
> make package_source
The resulting output files will be in the packages/ subdir of your
build directory.

As an alternate to cmake, there is a generic Makefile included which
might work for you.
